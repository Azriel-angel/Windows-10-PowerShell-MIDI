# Windows-10-PowerShell-MIDI
Use Windows 10 MIDI APIs from PowerShell to control all sorts of things

Currently, the code here includes only MIDI send, with the examples written for the Novation LaunchPad.

To use the MIDI API from PowerShell, copy the compiled C# DLL to the folder where your script resides (or some other convenient location) and update the import path in the script.

Requires Windows 10 and .NET 4.5.1 (installed with Windows 10)
